            <p>
              Over the past few months, promoters of Adani Group have reduced a
              significant portion of their holdings in group companies following
              the stake sale to US-based boutique investment firm, GQG Partners.
              A report suggests that Adani Group promoters may continue to
              decrease their holdings in the coming months.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objective behind this move, as reported by The Economic Times,
              is to create a liquidity buffer that can be utilized for equity
              infusion in various units and to explore new opportunities. The
              report highlights discussions with other global investors about
              the potential further reduction of holdings.
